# Exploring Github Copilot with DE examples

Copilot is a Large Language Model (LLM) which is fine tuned by Github to provide Code examples and developer support. Its interesting because Github being the developer friendly website has software development data from developers worldwide and that was used to fintetune Microsoft's LLM to give Github Copilot the wisdom of global software development to make a sort of ChatGPT for developers. As the audience here must have invariably interacted with ChatGPT if not directly with Copilot, we are plunging straight into Copilot without delving on how LLMs work or finetuning of LLMs. 


# Installation

To get started we would need 

1. Visual Studio Code Application
2. Github Copilot - This is a paid extension and will require you to put in pay information
3. Github Copilot Chat - This extension allows us to interact with Copilot like ChatGPT

# Prompts

With prompts **Context is King**

Two ways of using Copilot prompts. 

First is inline VS Code, where you're typing youre code logic in VS Code and it suggests generic syntax, this can be seen as an extention of code-completion or intellisense. 

Second is to chat in the Copilot prompt and that generates logic in response to the context that was input.
