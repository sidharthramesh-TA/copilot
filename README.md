# copilot
Github Copilot with DE examples

# Installation

To get started we would need 

1. Visual Studio Code Application
2. Github Copilot - This is a paid extension and will require you to put in pay information
3. Github Copilot Chat - This extension allows us to interact with Copilot like ChatGPT

Two ways of using Copilot prompts. First is inline VS Code, where you're typing youre code logic in VS Code and it suggests generic syntax, this can be seen as an extention of code-completion or intellisense. Second is to chat in the Copilot prompt and that generates logic in response to the context that was input. 

# Prompts
